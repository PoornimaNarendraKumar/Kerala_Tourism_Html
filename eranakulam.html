            <p>From ancient times Ernakulam district has played a part in the political history of south India. The
                Jews, Syrians, Arabs, Chinese, Dutch, British and Portuguese seafarers followed the sea route to Kingdom
                of Cochin and left their impressions in the town. In 1896, the Maharaja of Cochin initiated local
                administration by forming a town council in Ernakulam. Initially Ernakulam district's headquarters was
                at Ernakulam, which gave the district its name; the headquarters was later shifted to Kakkanad.</p>
