                and Vythiri Taluks are all in Wayanad.The name Wayanad comes from Vayal Nadu and it means the land
                of paddy fields. It is a high, flat land between 700 meters and 2100 meters above sea level. It is in
                northeaster Kerala, in the Western Ghat mountains. Wayandad is one of the biggest foreign exchange
                earners in Kerala because it makes money-earning crops like pepper, cardamom, coffee, tea, and other
                spices.

                In ancient times the Vedar Rajas ruled Wayanad. Later the Pazhassi Raja of the Kottayam Royal Dynasty
                ruled. Then there was a Mysorean invasion. Later, the British took over India, which lasted for 200
                years. The British fought the Pazhassi Rajah. When the state of Kerala started in 1956, Wayanad was part
                of the Cannannore district. In 1957, south Wayanad was added to Kozhikode district and north Wayanad
                stayed with Cannannore district. The district was formed on 1 November 1980 as the 12th district in
                Kerala by carving out areas from Kozhikode and Kannur districts.
