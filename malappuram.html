                Malappuram district is a district in the state of Kerala, India. The headquarters at Malappuram.

                The district was formed on 16 June 1969. Malappuram district is composed of portions of the former
                Palakkad and Kozhikode districts: Ernad taluk and portions of Tirur taluk in Kozhikode district, and
                portions of Perinthalmannna and Ponnani taluks in Palakkad district. In 1921 the present-day Malappuram
                district was part of the Moplah rebellions, followed by decades of stagnant economic, social and
                political development. In the early years of Communist rule in Kerala, Malappuram experienced land
                reform under the Land Reform Ordinance. During the 1970s Persian Gulf oil reserves were opened to
                commercial extraction, and thousands of unskilled workers migrated to the Gulf. They sent money home,
                supporting the rural economy, and by the late 20th century the region had First World health standards
                and near-universal literacy.
