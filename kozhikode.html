            <p>This historically significant beach is situated at a distance of 16 km from Kozhikode city. The unspoilt
                and unexplored beauty of this rock studded beach is amazing sight to visit. This beach is historically
                important being the place where Vasco Da Gama the first Portuguese Navigator landed. A stroll across the
                beach is a refreshing experience. There is wonderful resorts in Kappad Beach.</p>
