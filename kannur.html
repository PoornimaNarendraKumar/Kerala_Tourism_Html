        <p>Kannur District is one of the 14 districts along the west coast in the state of Kerala, India. The town of
            Kannur is the district headquarters and gives the district its name. The old name, Cannanore is the
            anglicised form of the Malayalam name "Kannur". Kannur district is bounded by Kasaragod District to the
            north, Kozhikode district to the south and Wayanad District to the southeast. To the east the district is
            bounded by the Western Ghats, which forms the border with the state of Karnataka (Kodagu district). The
            Arabian Sea is to the west. The district was established in 1957.

            Kannur is the sixth-most urbanized district in Kerala, with more than 50% of its residents living in urban
            areas. Kannur has an urban population of 1,212,898, which is the second largest in Kerala after Ernakulam
            district.</p>

            Kannur District is known as the land of looms and lores, because of the loom industries and ritualistic
            festivals held here in temples. The district is a major centre of Theyyam, a ritual dance of northern
            Kerala. Small shrines known as kavus, associated with the Theyyam, dot the district.

            The proposed Kannur International Airport will be the fourth international airport in Kerala and is in
            Mattannur, 26-km away from Kannur.
